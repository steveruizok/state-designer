# Design

A `design` is a blueprint for your [`state`](/docs/api/state). While a `state` manages information, it does so according to the `design` you provide.

In State Designer, you define your `design` in a single object. This object may include your state's initial `data` value, a tree of state nodes with associated event handlers, and collections of functions that can be used across those event handlers.

## Designing

Remember that State Designer treats state management as a _design_ problem. Its API was crafted around the idea that you'll use it to _decide_ how the state should work.
