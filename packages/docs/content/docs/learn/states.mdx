# States

When describing a user interface, we often use words like "stopped", "playing", or "paused" to describe the different ways that the interface can be. If we made these into a list, we would end up with a set of **states**, each of which might be active or inactive at a given moment.

You can define these states in your state's configuration object.

```js
const state = useStateDesigner({
  initial: "checked",
  states: {
    checked: {},
    unchecked: {},
  },
})
```

> **Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;We're overloading the word state here, sorry. In State Designer, the word "state" will generally refer to the current snapshot of all the information that matters to a user interface. However, _that_ state might also include information about which of the interface's "states" are currently active—is it playing or paused?

## Initial State

The **initial** property defines which of a state's states should be active first.

This kind of state—a state with both `states` and an `initial` state—is called a **compound state**. In a compound state, only one of its states can ever be active at a time. And so, when you define an `initial` property, the state with that name will start out as active and all other states will start out as inactive.

## Transitioning Between States

You can use the `to` property of a handler object to transition from one state to another. In a compound state, transitioning to a new state will deactivate its siblings.

We'll cover more about transitions in the next article.

## State Events

Any state can have its own set of events, too.

<LiveView snippet={"statesToggleEvents"} />

**A state's events may only trigger while that state is active**. An inactive state's events will be ignored. This makes it possible to respond to the same event in different ways, depending on which states are currently active.

In the example above, we've set up the checkbox to send `"TOGGLED"` each time that a user clicks the checkbox. In the state's configuration, the `checked` and `unchecked` states are both configured to handle this event in different ways. However, only one event will ever trigger at once, depending on which state is active.

## Which States are Active?

When you call `useStateDesigner`, the hook will return several helper methods that you can use to determine which states are active and which are inactive.

### isIn

You've already seen the [`isIn`](/docs/api/state#isIn) helper, which will return true or false depending on whether the provided state is active.

```js
state.isIn("checked") // true
```

You can also call `isIn` with more than one state name. In this case, the function will return true only if _all_ of the provided states are currently active.

```js
state.isIn("checked") // true
state.isIn("checked", "unchecked") // false
```

### isInAny

The [`isInAny`](/docs/api/state#isInAny) helper works just like `isIn`, except it will return true if _any_ of the provided states are currently active.

```js
state.isInAny("checked") // true
state.isInAny("checked", "unchecked") // true
```

### whenIn

You can use the [`whenIn`](/docs/api/state#isIn) helper to return different values depending on which states are active.

<LiveView snippet={"statesToggleWhenIn"} />

These three helpers gets their names from a popular metaphor for states: rooms in a building that can be entered and exited. Just like a person moving between rooms, your state can only be in one room at a time. But what if that room has another room inside of it?

## Nested States

One of the most powerful parts of State Designer (and its inspiration, [statecharts](https://statecharts.github.io/)) is the idea that any state can have its own states, too. You can add states to a state in the same way that you've added states to the root of your configuration object.

<LiveView snippet={"statesNestedToggle"} />

Whenever a **parent state** becomes active, its initial **child state** will also become active. You can then transition between those **sibling states**, too. When you deactivate a state by transitioning away from it, all of the state's **children** will also deactivate.

In this (contrived, over-sized) example, the `checked` state has two child states: `hovered` and `unhovered`. When a user transitions to the `checked` state, the `hovered` state will also automatically activate because it is the `checked` state's initial state.

Mousing over and away from the button will cause transitions between the `hovered` and `unhovered` states. Clicking the button again deactivates `checked` and all of its children (`hovered` and `unhovered`) too.

> **Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we're _really_ overloading the word "state". Your state can include states, each of which can have its own state. And, as you might have guessed already—your state is also a state.

## Parallel States

So far, we've looked at states that can only have one active child at a time, as specified by the `initial` property. Howver, if you _don't_ provide an initial property on a parent state, then any time that state is active, _all_ of its child states will be active, too.

<LiveView snippet={"statesParallel"} />

Parallel states are necessary for more complex state relationships such as the one above. Without parallel states, we would need to create combinatorial states, like `bold_and_underlined`. The number of such states would grow exponentially as we added more possible combinations.
