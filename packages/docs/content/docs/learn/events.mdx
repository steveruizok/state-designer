# Events

In your state design, an **event** allows you to define how your state should respond when something happens.

There are two kinds of events, **named events** and **auto-events**, that differ by how they can be **triggered**. All events belong to **state nodes** and will only trigger while that state node is active. When an event is triggered, its **handler** will run and, depending on what its handler does, the state may **update**.

## Named Events

You can define a state node's **named events** in its `on` property. To trigger a named event, call the state's `send` method with the event's name.

<LiveView snippet={"namedEvents"} />

In our example, we've defined an event called `"OPENED_ALERT"`.

> Can you change the event's name to "WAVED_HELLO"?

You can call the `send` method from anywhere in your project's code. Often you'll be sending events as the result of some user interaction, such as a click or a key press, but you can also send events using timers, effects, or even other state designs.

> **Tip:**&nbsp;&nbsp;As you build a user interface, you'll often find that several interactions will all produce the same event. For this reason, it's better to name events after _what_ the user did (opened an alert) rather than _how_ they did it (clicked a button). Otherwise, you might end up with key presses sending events named `"CLICKED"`!

### Using Named Events in Compound States

You can define events on any state node. In order for a state node's named event to trigger, that state node has to be active at the time of the `send` call.

> **Tip:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Events that you define in your design's root `on` property will belong to your design's root state node. This node will always be active, so events defined here will always trigger when sent.
>
> ```jsx
> createState({
>   on: { SOME_ROOT_EVENT: () => alert("I'm sure to trigger.")
> })
> ```

Events belonging to currently inactive states will be ignored. You can use this fact to design a state that handles the same event in different ways depending on which of its states are currently active.

### Using Named Events in Multiple States

If the same event is defined on a state node and its parent state node, then `send`ing the event's name will trigger it in both places. The parent state node's event will trigger first, followed by its child's event.

<LiveView snippet={"namedEventsParentChild"} />

### Using Named Events in Parallel States

In a parallel state, all child states are simultaneously active. If more than one child of a parallel state handles the same event, then the event will be triggered in order of the state definitions, starting from the top.

<LiveView snippet={"namedEventsParentChildParallel"} />

### Breaking the Event Chain

When a named event will be handled in more than one place (as in the previous two examples) any **transition** will break this chain of events.

<LiveView snippet={"eventsBreakingChain"} />

In the example above, the event was not handled on the `childB` event because `childA`'s handler included a transition.

## Auto-Events

A state's auto-events will trigger automatically under certain circumstances.

<LiveView snippet={"eventsAutoEvents"} />

> **🏆 Challenge**
>
> Can you add an `onExit` auto-event to the `raining` state that closes the umbrella?

Each state has several auto-events.

- `onEnter` will trigger when the state becomes active
- `onExit` will trigger when the state becomes inactive
- `onEvent` will trigger whenever an event occurs while the state is active
- `repeat` includes an auto-event that will trigger on an interval
- `async` includes auto-events, `onResolve` and `onReject`, for working with Promises

### Using Auto-Events to Create Transient States

Auto-events may occur as the result of transitions, but they can also lead to new transitions. You can use this fact to create **transient states** that will immediately transition to some other state based on conditions.

## Not All Events Will Cause Updates

When a state updates, it will notify its subscribers. In React, this will also update any component subscribed to the state through the `useStateDesignerer` hook.

While events are the _only_ way to produce an update, not _every_ event will cause an update. A state will only update if an event actually caused an action to run or a transition to occur.

- If you call the `send` method with the name of an event that does not appear in your state design, the state will not update.

- If you call the `send` method with the name of an event that belongs to a currently inactive state, that event will not trigger and the state will not update.

- If an event is triggered but the event's handler does not include an action or transition, or if those handlers conditions prevent the action or transition from occuring, then the state will not update.
