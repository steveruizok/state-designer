# State

At the heart of State Designer is the **state**. In this guide, we'll use the `useStateDesigner` hook to learn about creating and configuring states in a React project.

## Creating a State

The easiest way to create a state in a React project is to pass a **configuration object** to the `useStateDesigner` hook. This hook is exported from the `@state-designer/react` package.

```jsx
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"
```

<LiveView snippet="state" />

This configuration object will contain everything about the state: its initial data, events, child states, and collections. We'll learn about all of these parts in the following articles.

## Shared States

You can also create a state outside of a component by passing a configuration object to the `createStateDesigner` function.

```jsx
import { createStateDesigner, useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

const counter = createStateDesigner({
  data: { count: 0 },
  on: {
    INCREASED: (data) => data.count++,
    DECREASED: (data) => data.count--,
  },
})
```

You can then pass this state to a component's `useStateDesigner` hook. In this way, you can subscribe many different components to the same external state.

<LiveView snippet="stateCounter" />
