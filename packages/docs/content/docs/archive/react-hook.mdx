# React Hook

In the last article, we learned about responding to a state's updates through the state's `onUpdate` method. That's fine for a regular JavaScript project—and we could use this method in a React project, too. However, to make things easier, State Designer's [React package](/docs/usage/react) includes a hook named <b>`useStateDesign`</b> that does most of the work for us.

## Global and Local States

The `useStateDesign` hook is designed to work in two different ways:

1.  If you pass it a **state** that you've created with `createStateDesign`, the hook will subscribe the component to the state's updates.

    ```jsx
    import { createStateDesign } from "@state-designer/core"
    import { useStateDesign } from "@state-designer/react"

    const state = createStateDesign({ data: { count: 1 } })

    function Example() {
      // highlight-next-line
      const update = useStateDesign(state)

      return <h1>{update.data.count}</h1>
    }
    ```

2.  If you pass it a **configuration object**, the hook will create a new state and then subscribe the component to the state's updates.

    ```jsx
    import { createStateDesign } from "@state-designer/core"
    import { useStateDesign } from "@state-designer/react"

    function Example() {
      // highlight-next-line
      const update = useStateDesign({ data: { count: 1 } })

      return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
    }
    ```

In either case, any time the state updates, then the component will update, too.

## What's the difference?

You can use the first pattern to subscribe multiple components to the same state. In this way, you can use State Designer to create a **global state** that will drive updates to many components across your project.

You can use the second pattern to create a **local state** for each instance of a particular component. This pattern is useful for inputs, buttons, and other components that may appear many times in your project but that should each maintain an independent state.

> **Tip:** While we'll use the local state pattern for the rest of this guide, remember that the configuration objects work exactly the same in both cases.

In the next article, we'll learn to trigger a state's updates by sending it events.
