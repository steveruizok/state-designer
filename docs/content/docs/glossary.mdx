# Glossary

The **State Designer** library introduces several new words and terms. On this page, you'll find a list of each word and its meaning to State Designer.

## Action

A function that receives the machine's current `data`, `payload`, and `result`, and which may mutate the machine's [data](#data).

Like other [collectable functions](#collection), you can define an action either in the machine's `actions` [collection](#collection) or inline. You can place an action in an [event handler](#event-handler) object under the `do` property, or else use an action in place of an event handler object.

```jsx
const machine = createStateDesigner({
  data: { count: 0 },
  on: {
    MINUS_CLICKED: { do: "decrementCount" }
    PLUS_CLICKED: "incrementCount",
    CHANGE_CLICKED: (data, payload) => data.count += payload
  },
  actions: {
    incrementCount(data, payload, result) {
      data.count++
    },
    decrementCount(data, payload, result) {
      data.count--
    }
  }
})
```

In the example above, the machine has three actions: `incrementCount`, `decrementCount`, and an inline action.

## Active

When a [state](#state) is active, the machine [is in](#is-in) that state. A state may become active as the result of:

- a direct [transition](#transition) to the state itself
- a transition to one of the state's [descendants](#state-tree)
- a transition to one of the state's [ancestors](#state-tree) (in certain circumstances)

## Async

## Auto Event

## Branch State

A branch state is a [state](#state) that has child states **and** an [initial state](#initial-state). While a branch state is active, one (and only one) of its child states will be active.

```js
const machine = createStateDesigner({
  initial: "idle",
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: { SELECT: { to: "selected" } }
    },
    // highlight-start
    selected: {
      initial: "waiting"
      states: {
        waiting: {
          on: { DRAG_START: { to: "dragging" } }
        },
        dragging: {
          on: { DRAG_END: { to: "waiting" } }
        },
      }
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
})
```

In the example above, the `selected` state is a branch state. When `selected` becomes active, its child state `waiting` will also become active.

## Condition

## Configuration

## Data

A value stored in a machine. It is (optionally) created through the `data` property of a machine's [configuration](#configuration). The data's current value is passed to all [results](#results), [conditions](#conditions) and [actions](#actions) as those functions' first argument. You can mutate a machine's data using [actions](#actions). Any event that causes a data mutation will cause the machine to update.

```jsx
const machine = createStateDesigner({
  // highlight-start
  data: {
    count: 0
  },
  // highlight-end
  on: {
    PLUS_CLICKED: {
      if: "belowMax",
      do: "incrementCount"
    }
  },
  actions: {
    incrementCount(data) {
      data.count++
    }
  },
  conditions: {
    belowMax(data) {
      return data.count < 10
    }
  }
})
```

## Event

## Event Handler

## If

## IfAny

## Inactive

## Initial State

An initial state is a [state](#state) that will become active when its parent state becomes active — unless the transition that caused the change was a [previous](#previous) or [restore](#restore) transition.

## isIn

## Machine

## onEnter

## onEvent

## onExit

## Parallel State

A parallel state is a [state](#state) that has child states but no [initial state](#initial-state). While a parallel state is active, all of its child states will also be active.

```js
const machine = createStateDesigner({
  initial: "idle",
  states: {
    idle: {},
    // highlight-start
    selected: {
      states: {
        italic: {
          initial: "inactive",
          states: {
            inactive: {
              on: { TOGGLE_ITALIC: { to: "active" } }
            },
            active: {
              on: { TOGGLE_ITALIC: { to: "inactive" } }
            }
          }
        },
        bold: {
          initial: "inactive",
          states: {
            inactive: {
              on: { TOGGLE_BOLD: { to: "active" } }
            },
            active: {
              on: { TOGGLE_BOLD: { to: "inactive" } }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
})
```

In the example above, the `selected` state is a parallel state.

## Previous

## Restore

## Result

## Send

## State

A state represents a specific way that the machine can be, such as "playing", "stopped", or "paused".

In each update, a particular state may be either [active]("#active") or [inactive]("#inactive"). A state may have its own [events](#events) that the machine will handle when the state is [active](#active), as well as [auto events](#auto-events) that will fire when the state is entered, exited, or while the state is active.

A state may have child states. Whenever any of a state's child states becomes active, the parent state will also become active.

```js
const machine = createStateDesigner({
  initial: "idle",
  states: {
    // highlight-start
    idle: {
      on: { DRAG_START: { to: "dragging" } }
    },
    dragging: {
      on: { DRAG_END: { to: "idle" } }
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
})
```

In the example above, both `idle` and `dragging` are states.
