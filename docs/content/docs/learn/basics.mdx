# Basics

In this article, you'll learn the basics of State Designer: how to create a state, subscribe to its updates, and send it events.

## Creating a State

In State Designer, we create a **state** by passing a configuration object—or **config**—to the `createStateDesigner` function.

```js
import { createStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/core"

const state = createStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })
```

The config object will contain everything about the state: its events, initial data, a tree of child states, and collections of re-usable functions. We'll learn about all of these parts in the following articles.

> **Tip:** Complex states can become quite large. To help you keep your config on track, the `createStateDesigner` function offers TypeScript support throughout the object. To create a config separately without losing this type support, use the `createConfig` function. [Learn more](/docs/api/createConfig).

## Updates

Certain events will cause a state to **update**. We can **subscribe** to a state's updates by passing a callback function to the state's `onUpdate` method.

```js
state.onUpdate(() => {
  document.getElementById("count").textContent = state.data.count
})
```

The state will call this function each time it updates. In the body of the function, we can make changes to our project based on the state's current information.

> **Note:** The `onUpdate` function also receives the new state as an argument. While the state itself is mutable, certain parts of the state are immutable. [Learn more](/docs/api/onUpdate).

## In React

If you're using React, you can use the `useStateDesigner` hook to subscribe a component to a state's updates. You have two options:

You can create your state using `createStateDesigner` and pass it into the `useStateDesigner` hook.

```js
import { createStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/core"
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

// highlight-next-line
const state = createStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })

function Example() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const update = useStateDesigner(state)

  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass a configuration object directly to the `useStateDesigner` hook. This will create a new state and subscribe to its changes.

```js
import { createStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/core"
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

function Example() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const update = useStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })

  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

Each option has its benefits:

If you create a state outside of a component, you can subscribe any number of components to the same state. This is useful for creating **global** states.

If you create a state inside of a component, by passing the config directly to the `useStateDesigner` hook, then this state is unique to the component instance. This is useful for creating reusable **local** states.
